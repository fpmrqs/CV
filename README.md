## Francisco Pottinger-Marques

I'm a Software Engineer recently graduated from Makers Academy. I come from a Graphic Design background and have worked in the Print Industry for the last 6 years, so I'm transitioning from making physical products to building digital ones. Even though I'm an engineer first, design and user experience will always be close to my heart. I'm very excited about building meaningful software that makes a difference on people's daily experiences.

## Work Experience

**Printstore** (January 2019 to September 2021)  
_Pre-press and Digital Specialist_

- Checking, editing, imposing and proofing artwork. This part of the job was very detail oriented and relies on tripple checking every corner of each page, as a small mistake will result on big waste.
- Communcating with the production team to assure a smooth run of each job. 
- Maintaining online shop by updating products details.

**ABC Imaging** (December 2016 to December 2018)  
_Pre-flight Operator_

- Imposing and writing instructions for each print job.
- Liasing with clients to understand requirements.
- Overseeing workflow to make sure products will be despatched on time.

## Skills

#### Initiative

I moved back to the UK after University in 2015 and despite not having a network of people to help me, I worked hard and put myself in front of the opportunities I wanted by not being afraid of being uncomfortable. I built a career in a different industry and I'm happy to be doing it all over again by transitioning into tech.

#### Eager Learner
During my employment at Printstore, my line manager was impressed with how quickly I became proficient at the different softwares used in the role and mentioned I went on to gain knowledge beyond what was offered by their training. For my [final project](https://github.com/ravensears/RPG-Game) at Makers, despite not having time to add the game features that would make use of them, I learned and implemented database and authentication features using MongoDB and Passport.js for future development of the project.

#### Communication and Mentorship
Throughout my career in print I had liase with clients/graphic designers, extract technical requirements from their ideas and explain these back to them. At Makers, I've been enthusiastic about helping peers understand concepts whenever I can and became a mentor to two developers just starting the course.
