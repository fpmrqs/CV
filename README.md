## Francisco Pottinger-Marques

I am an enthusiastic Software Engineer who recently graduated
from Makers Academy, an intensive 16 weeks course where I
had the chance to develop my engineering skills and learn the best
practices adopted in the tech industry.  

I fell in love with coding ever since first trying to learn the
basics, and what was once something I did in my spare time now has my full attention and commitment. Since then I have been
learning by building full-stack applications using technologies
like Javascript, NodeJs, and Ruby-on-Rails.  

My creative and technical skills acquired through my bachelor's
degree in design, and experience working across the print
industry, translate well into coding, and lead to imaginative and
pragmatic results.

## Work Experience

**Printstore** (January 2019 to September 2021)  
_Pre-press and Digital Specialist_

- Checking, editing, imposing, and proofing artwork. This part of the job was very detail-oriented and relied on triple-checking every corner of each page, as a small mistake will result in wasted time and resources
- Communicating with the production team to assure a smooth run of each job. I managed to build a positive, friendly relationship with the team running the presses to facilitate the daily exchanges
- Maintaining online shops; B2B services included managing clients' shop fronts and updating artwork on demand. Most products are to be live without delay and my time management skills helped me to achieve this

**ABC Imaging** (December 2016 to December 2018)  
_Pre-flight Operator_

- Imposing and writing instructions for each print job for my colleagues in production. This was a very technical role and writing clear, simple, efficient instructions to the production team was essential
- Liaising with clients to understand product requirements. Translating the client's needs to technical requirements was critical to the product's final look and feel
- Overseeing workflow and dealing with delays. Decision-making and problem-solving had to be applied daily as my team was the link between production and demanding clients

## Skills

#### Attention to detail

While studying graphic design and working in the print industry it was critical to pay the utmost attention to all aspects of what I was producing ranging from the text, images, and format. A mistake in graphic or print order could realistically result in thousands of pounds in reprints, delays, and customer dissatisfaction

#### Fast Learner
During my employment at Printstore, my line manager was impressed with how quickly I became proficient in the different software used in the role and mentioned I went on to gain knowledge beyond what was offered by their training. For my [final project](https://github.com/ravensears/RPG-Game) at Makers, despite not having time to add the game features that would make use of them, I learned and implemented database and authentication features using MongoDB and Passport.js for future development of the project.

#### Communication and Mentorship
Throughout my career in print, I had to liaise with clients/graphic designers, extract technical requirements from their ideas and explain these back to them. At Makers, I've been enthusiastic about helping peers understand concepts whenever I can and became a mentor to two developers just starting the course.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (December 2021 to March 2022)
16 weeks immersive fully remote coding bootcamp covering the following subjects:
- Daily pair programming, enhancing problem-solving and teamwork skills
- Object-oriented programming best practices
- Test-driven development: we were writing unit tests from day one
- Technologies used: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB
- Frameworks used for testing: RSpec, Jest

#### Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Brazil (2009 to 2015)

- BA Design
- The four years degree covered Graphic and Product Design
- Had two different internships helping internal departments to plan and run University events

#### Middlesex University, UK (2013 to 2014)

- Graphic Design
- I was granted a fully-funded scholarship to study abroad as part of a Brazilian government exchange program

## Hobbies and Interests

- Graphic Design remains a big interest and its principles can be applied to pretty much any industry. I tend to spend a little extra time learning about styles when building applications
- Baking: I love making things with my hands after a busy week of computer-based work. It's just like writing algorithms, but we can eat the output
- Videogames: I grew up playing Super Nintendo in the 90s and have never stopped. I had a lot of fun building a Javascript game for my final project at Makers
